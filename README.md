All the git CLI I tend to look up too many times

## Branch out, merge the branch back in and delete the branch

##### Create a new Branch with specific branch name
`git checkout -b branch_name`

##### Merge the branch into the master
`git merge branch_name`

##### Delete the old branch after the merge
`git branch -d branch_name`
